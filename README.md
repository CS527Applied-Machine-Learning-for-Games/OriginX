# OriginX : Destroy to Create!


# Game Overview
## Interactive Quest-based Combat Game

The goal of OriginX is to develop a combat game where the player fights against an AI agent to defeat the agent and advance to the next level. The player wins the game by defeating the AI agent at every level. We have used different techniques of machine learning, primarily based on reinforcement learning. We hope to expand the scope to integrate more levels and different features.

The player and the AI agent, both, have a health bar that is initially at a maximum level. For each hit that the AI agent takes from the player, it loses a certain value of health. When the health bar of the AI agent reaches zero, it loses that level and the player wins.
